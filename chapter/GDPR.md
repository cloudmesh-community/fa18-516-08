In this chapter we will cover the general guidelines of GDPR in relation to cloud computing and how it applies to the businesses inside and outside Europen Union. We will touch upon the terms data processor and data controllers for cloud computing as related to GDPR compliance. We will also cover GDPR readiness and privacy statements of some common cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. We will also present geenral market outlook in the wake of GDPR for preference of public vs private cloud and finally talk about the open source platform Openstack and how community contribution can be GDPR compliant.

# GDPR Compliance
The core of the GDPR comliance is to protect EU citizens from privacy and data breaches ("GDPR Key Challenges",https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/).
We may wonder that GDPR is applicable only for the protection of EU citizens and the organizations based outside of EU do not need to be GDPR compliant. However, GDPR is applicable to any organization with business in EU and collect,store and process data of EU citizens. With the digital age and the organizations moving towards cloud computing, the GDPR brings new challenges both for cloud computing vendors who have data centers in EU as well as for organizations like Uber, Visa, Apple and many more who are ubiquitous in their business models and deal with EU citizens personal data.
https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/  lists personal data as defined in Article 4 of GDPR - "‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;" In simpler language it could be any information like identification number (US equivalent for SSN),phone number, address, birth date, IP address etc. which can uniquely identify a person.
GDPR compliance poses strict fines for any personal data breach. Fines are either upto 23 million USD or 4 % of annual revenue.
To summarize, GDPR compliance will protect EU citizens personal data and will enforce organizations worldwide to be GDPR compliant. Under GDPR, it is mandatory for organizations to disclose how and when personal data is collected, what it is used for and how the data will be erased when the data subject is no longer needed or chosses to opt out.
